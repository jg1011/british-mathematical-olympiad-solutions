# British Mathematical Olympiad Solutions

Due to absurd copyright laws this project can no longer be pursued. I elect to leave the solutions I've already written here for two reasons: 

1) The work here is all my own and the papers are already publicly accessible, there is no reasonable case here.
2) Mathematics is to be shared, putting up barriers only stunts the growth of our next generation of mathematicians.

Originally, I wanted to open source this and collect solutions to all the old BMO1/2 papers. At the request of Geoff Smith personally I have decided to no longer pursue this element of the project. Future interesting solutions will be delegated to articles.
