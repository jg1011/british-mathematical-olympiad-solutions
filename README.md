# The British Mathematical Olympiad: Unofficial Solutions Manual

The idea of this repo is to host solutions to BMO papers lacking official solutions. For some official solutions consult [the videos](https://bmos.ukmt.org.uk/solutions/) and Geoff Smith's books on the matter. I intend for this to be an open sourced project, as I have insufficient freetime to get through every paper. To make this project feasible, only papers after the turn of the Millenium are considered. 

For comments, corrections, missing solutions and interesting alternative solutions, please email me at

Better yet, make a pull request! Try to follow the style used throughout the document as closely as possible if making a pull request. If you're not experienced with git an email will suffice, though I may not get around to adding it immediately. Typed solutions (with a tex file attached) are **much** preferred.

New/alternative solutions will be credited to their original authors. Those who highlight errors will receive a mention in an appendix. That said, if one prefers to remain anonymous then their wishes will be respected. 

I am no good at Euclidean geometry, so I've skipped these problems. A geometry enthusiast's help is highly desired!

I've tried to always give the most elementary solution (or as Erd≈ës would say, the "book proof") as this is what would realistically be expected of a candidate. Sometimes some advanced theory kills the problem. If this is the case, and if I'm aware of the theory, I remark on it for interested readers, but do not design my solution around it. In general, if a theorem trivialises a problem it is expected that a proof of said theorem is to be supplied.
